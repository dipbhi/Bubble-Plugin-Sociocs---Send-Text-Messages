    "description": "Send text messages from your Sociocs connected channels. 💬\n\nEnable two-way conversations with your Bubble app users with the Sociocs inbox. For example, you send an order confirmation from your bubble app, which is also visible in your Sociocs inbox. When your user/customer replies to that message, it comes to the Sociocs inbox, from where you can reply back.\n\nThis plugin offers two actions, you can use either or both depending upon your use case.\n\n1. \"Send Sociocs Message\" - To send outbound message.\n2. \"Save Sociocs Incoming\" - To add an incoming message from your user/customer (e.g. a form submission or a simulated entry to save details which can be useful later.)\n\nCurrently it works for SMS/text messaging (i.e. Twilio channel) and WhatsApp (i.e. Twilio and Gupshup channels).\n\nPlugin instructions: https://docs.sociocs.com/integrations/bubble/plugin-send-text-messages/#plugin-installation\n\nThis plugin itself is FREE, however, it requires a FREE TRIAL or PAID account on Sociocs to use the necessary API for this plugin.\n\nSociocs inbox is available as web app and mobile apps.\n\n- Web App: https://app.sociocs.com\n- Mobile Apps: https://mobileapps.page.link/sociocs\n\nOther plugins: https://sociocs-plugins.bubbleapps.io/version-test/",
