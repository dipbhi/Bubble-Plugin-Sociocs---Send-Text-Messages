    "description": "Send text messages from your Sociocs connected channels. ðŸ’¬\n\nEnable two-way conversations with your Bubble app users with the Sociocs inbox. For example, you send an order confirmation from your bubble app, which is also visible in your Sociocs inbox. When your user/customer replies to that message, it comes to the Sociocs inbox, from where you can reply back. You can also add an incoming message from your user/customer (e.g. a form submission or a simulated entry to save details which can be useful later.)\n\nThis plugin offers two actions, you can use either or both depending upon your use case.\n\n1. \"Send Sociocs Message\" - To send outbound message.\n2. \"Save Sociocs Incoming\" - To add incoming user/customer message to your app to Sociocs or save details before sending outbound message.\n\nCurrently it works for SMS/text messaging (i.e. Twilio channel) and WhatsApp (i.e. Twilio and Gupshup channels).\n\nSociocs inbox is available as web app and mobile apps.\n\n- Web App: https://app.sociocs.com\n- Mobile Apps: https://mobileapps.page.link/sociocs\n\nThis plugin itself is FREE, however, it requires a FREE TRIAL or PAID account on Sociocs to use the necessary API for this plugin.\n\nOther plugins: https://sociocs-plugins.bubbleapps.io/version-test/\n\n(If you are looking at this description from within the \"Installed Plugins\" page of your Bubble app, click on the \"Plugin page â†’\" link on the top-right for instructions about where to get values for the plugin configuration.)",
